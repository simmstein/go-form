# go-form

Creating and processing HTML forms is hard and repetitive. You need to deal with rendering HTML form fields, validating submitted data, mapping the form data into objects and a lot more. [`go-form`][go-form] includes a powerful form feature that provides all these features.

[`go-form`][go-form] is heavily influenced by [Symfony Form](https://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html). It includes:

* A form builder based on fields declarations and independent of structs
* Validation based on constraints
* Data mounting to populate a form from a struct instance
* Data binding to populate a struct instance from a submitted form
* Form renderer with customizable themes
